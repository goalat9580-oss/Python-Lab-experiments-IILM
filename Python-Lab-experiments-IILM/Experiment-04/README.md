# Experiment–04

## Problem statement 
Write a program to find Union of Two Sets Using Python

** Input sets **
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1 }
set2 = {3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2}

**Output:**
The unioun set is {1, 2 ,3}


## Algorithm  
1. Define two sets with some elements.  
2. Use Python’s `union()` method to combine both sets.  
3. Store the result in a new set.  
4. Display the union set.
